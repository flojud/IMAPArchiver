# IMAPArchiver

Hello, fellow developers! ðŸ‘‹ 

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where your IMAP mailbox is getting a bit too full, and you're concerned about losing important data? The IMAPArchiver is here to help you keep your mailbox organized and ensure that no email goes missing.

This handy script was designed to address the issue of a full IMAP mailbox while ensuring that no data is lost. By exporting your emails to a local folder, you can safely backup your email data and store it in cloud storage solutions like OneDrive. This enables easy access to old documents and provides a reliable backup solution for your important emails.

The IMAPArchiver allows you to export emails from an IMAP mailbox to a local folder. It provides a user-friendly command-line interface with various options to customize the export process.


## Features

- Export emails from an IMAP mailbox to a local folder.
- Filter emails based on the specified year.
- Support for SSL connection.
- Option to skip specific IMAP folders.
- Verbose logging and debug mode for detailed output.
